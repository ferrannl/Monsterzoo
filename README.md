# Monsterzoo 🐲

**Monsterzoo** is a small browser-based JavaScript game built as an _Eindopdracht JavaScript_ (final assignment).  
You manage a zoo full of monsters: create them, customize them, place them on different fields, and move or delete them while dealing with changing weather conditions.

## Overview

Monsterzoo is a front-end JavaScript app that demonstrates:

- Object-oriented JavaScript (classes, instances, composition)
- Modular code split across multiple files (`Zoo.js`, `Monster.js`, `Monsterconfig.js`, etc.)
- A Webpack-based build pipeline that bundles everything into a `/dist` folder
- Separation of raw assets (in `resources/`) from compiled output (in `dist/`)

A packaged build is also available here:  
👉 **Releases:** https://github.com/ferrannl/Monsterzoo/releases

## Game Mechanics & Features

From the original project description:

> **Monster Zoo** – Create, customize, place, move and delete monsters on different fields (with different weather conditions).

Core concepts include:

- **Monster objects** – encapsulated monster data & behaviour  
- **Zoo management** – `Zoo` class manages monster collections  
- **Configuration layer** – `Monsterconfig` connects UI with logic  
- **Field & weather system** – monsters can be placed on areas with different weather  
- **Webpack-bundled app** – output ends up in `dist/`
